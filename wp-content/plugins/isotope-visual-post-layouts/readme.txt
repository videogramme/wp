= Do I need a licence to use this? =

New Isotope licence terms, mean you don't need a licence to use this plugin *as-is*

= Can I change your CSS / HTML or the Isotope Javascript? =

You can change the CSS or the JS with a commercial licence from Metafizzy and a Pro licence from me. 

Please remember that I paid for a licence so you can use this for free.


= When I resize my browser window smaller nothing happens =

Hmm it sounds like your theme has fixed widths. You need a responsive theme for the resize animation effect to work.

== Screenshots ==

1. Isotope Settings Page -- not much too it really just some helpful tips to get you started
2. The finished page showing 10 recent posts. Resize your browser window to see them animate.
